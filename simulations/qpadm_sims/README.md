Simulation taken from https://gsajournals.figshare.com/articles/dataset/Supplemental_Material_for_Harney_et_al_2020/13403225

We have three different simulations:

- <b>Harney_etal</b>: Original qpAdm simulation.
- <b>Harney_etal_modified</b>: We divided all timings by 5 in the demographic model to make the admixture event more difficult to quantify.
-  <b>Harney_etal_contmig</b>: Simulation taken from Harney et al simulating continuous migrations between adjacent 'islands' on a 1d grid.

In each case, you can execute ```run.sh```.
