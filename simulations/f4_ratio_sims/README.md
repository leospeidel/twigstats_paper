# f4-ratio simulations

## Eight simulations:

Please consult the paper for details about these simulations.

Shared between all simulations is that we simulate five populations named PI, PO, P1, P2, and PX, 
as described in our paper (Speidel et al, 2024). In this simulation PX is admixed between P1 and P2.

Please copy scripts from ````scripts/```` or ````scripts_error/```` into each directory, change paths to Relate in the ````run_relate.sh```` script and then run ````./simulate.sh````
